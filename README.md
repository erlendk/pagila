# Pagila


Pagila is a port of the Sakila example database available for MySQL, which was
originally developed by Mike Hillyer of the MySQL AB documentation team. It
is intended to provide a standard schema that can be used for examples in
books, tutorials, articles, samples, etc.

The schema and data for the Sakila database were made available under the BSD license
which can be found at http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php. The pagila
database is made available under this license as well.
